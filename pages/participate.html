<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's kind of like a hackathon, but focused on developing material and
tools for documentation. Hackers of all skill-levels are welcome.
<strong>The docathon will be held the week of March 6th, 2017</strong>.
We'll have a kickoff event on the 6th, and then a week of hacking and
documenting. We hope you'll join us in person or online! 
</p>

<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Docstrings are incomplete or missing argument explanations,
examples don't compile or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.
</div>
<div class="span-3">
<h2>How Do I Join In?</h2>
We welcome anyone who would either like to contribute to documentation, or
who has a project (preferably open-source) that could use some documentation
love. If you're interested, click one of the buttons below and answer a couple
questions.<br />

                <h1>What can I do at the docathon?</h1>
<p>There are two main ways to get involved with the docathon.</p>
<p>First, you can offer a project that could use some documentation love. This might be an open-source package that is lacking in examples, that needs docstring improvements, or that simply needs somebody other than the author to make decisions about how to describe things. It could also be a tool or codebase that is designed to help with documentation or make it more effective.</p>
<p>Second, you can offer your own time during the docathon to work on the projects that are officially on-board. Alternatively, you can work on your own personal projects (so long as you're working on documentation!).</p>
<p>We'll have a list of projects with (mostly) clearly-defined projects that could be tackled over the course of the week. This will be the main watering hole for both listing and finding projects to work on. </p>
<h2>If you have a project you'd like to include in the docathon:</h2>
<p>Check back here soon. We'll post a link to sign up in a few weeks.</p>
