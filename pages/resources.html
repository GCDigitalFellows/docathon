<h2>What's a docathon?</h2>
<p>
It's kind of like a hackathon, but focused on developing material and
tools for documentation. Hackers of all skill-levels are welcome.
<strong>The docathon will be held in late February, 2017</strong>,
stay tuned for more details on dates. It will hopefully be the first
of many docathons to come! 
</p>
</div>
<div class="span-3">
<h2>Why a docathon?</h2>
Everybody knows how important documentation is. 
However, as important as it is, we often don't give documentation enough
attention. Docstrings are incomplete or missing argument explanations,
examples don't compile or reveal outdated APIs, tutorials are often
idiosynchratic (or not even there). The docathon is about changing that.
</div>
<div class="span-3">
<h2>How Do I Join In?</h2>
All you need is a project to work on that isn't your regular day job. We
recommend you choose something open, perhaps on GitHub or Bitbucket, so that
others can see your progress. In the coming weeks we'll send out a formal call
for ideas and projects, and you can sign up then either as a project host
or as a contributor.

                <p>Below we'll keep a semi-updated list of resources that we've found useful in writing and improving our own documentation. If you've got a suggestion for something else to add, please add it as a comment to our github issue on this <a href="https://github.com/BIDS/docathon/issues/5">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Documentation tools</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Python</h2>
<h3>numpydoc</h3>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/numpydoc">numpydoc</a> is a set of extension to
sphinx initially used by the numpy project and now more widely used in the
scientific ecosystem. Among other it provide extra sphinx directives, and
understand the numpy docstring syntax.</p>
<h3>Napoleon</h3>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-napoleon">Sphinxcontrib-napoleon</a>
is a set of extension for Sphinx which understand both NumPy and Google style
docstrings.</p>
<h3>Doctr</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/drdoctr/doctr">Doctr</a> is meant to simplify the deployment
of documentation from Travis-CI to GitHub pages, by providing a single tool to
setup, build and deploying documentation build. </p>
<p>It is an alternative to readthedocs where it is not always simple to get all
dependency installed.</p>
<p>Doctr is still young and an easy to contribute project with a number of missing
features. </p>
<h3>Sphinx Gallery</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sphinx-gallery/sphinx-gallery">Sphinx Gallery</a> is a Sphinx
Extensions that will automatically generate a gallery from a repository of
examples.</p>
<p>Sphinx Gallery automatically make all identifiers present in every code block
to link to their definition. In conjunction with [intersphinx] this is allow
seamless navigation in between related projects. </p>
<h3>Documentation portals</h3>
<p>The following tools enter the category of "Documentation portals" they attempt
to gather documentation from several source in a coherent, uniform and
searchable portal. </p>
<p><a href="http://devdocs.io/">Devdocs</a> started as a portal to gather documentation for
javascript only. Now expanded to many project. Browser based but store content
in local storage so available online projects need to opt-in a write a
"Scrapper" to parse already existing HTML docs.</p>
<p>It <em>not</em> have a concept of next-previous page so is not meant for read-through
tutorials.</p>
<p><a href="https://kapeli.com/dash">Dash</a> is a similar project. It is though (for now)
available for MacOS only, as native application. It is capable to get online
resources, but is mostly meant to work off-line.</p>
<p><a href="https://pydoc.io">PyDoc</a> fills again a similar niche.  PyDoc first version
were made public at end of 2016. Unlike the two above, PyDoc is meant to be
Python only, and has no intent to be available off-line. Its tight integration
with Python should allows it to automatically build <em>api only</em> docs for all
Python project on PyPI and Warehouse. </p>
<h3>Miscs</h3>
<p><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/docrepr">Docrepr</a> extend the concept of
MimeBundle that can be found in IPython and Jupyter to extend it to python's
docstring. Using docrepr, the Jupyter Notebook and Spyder can show docstring of
interactive object using rich html. </p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/michaelpacer/thebe-test">thebe test</a> is a prototype to make
example written using sphinx interactive and backed by an actual running
kernel. Either running on a temporary server in the cloud (like SymPy
documentation console), or even cnnecting to a locally running jupyter notebook
server. </p>
